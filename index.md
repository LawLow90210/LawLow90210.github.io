I am a CompSci major, with a set focus on CyberSecurity. I plan to get my Bachelor's Degree in 2027, and my Masters around 2029-2030.

## Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

Parking/Lab #7
This lab became a favorite because it turned messy real-world signage into crisp Boolean logic. I had to juggle overlapping restrictions, 24-hour time, and the ends at :59 policy, which sharpened my attention to edge cases. I also practiced clean input validation and clear error messages, then mapped arguments to well-named functions so the main stayed readable. The unit tests pushed me to think through Tuesday sweeping vs. nighttime bans and the special 6:30 AM start on Date Street. Overall, it was a satisfying blend of careful reasoning and tidy, testable code.

Spell Checker/Lab #9 Part 1 
I liked this one because it forced me to handle strings and files at scale without getting sloppy. Reading a dictionary, normalizing cases, stripping punctuation, and checking each token taught me to build small helper functions that each do one thing well. I learned how to avoid common pitfalls in parsing (like off-by-one and leftover punctuation) and to structure loops so performance stays acceptable. It also showed me the value of early error checks and meaningful messages when files are missing or inputs are malformed. The end result felt practical and professional.

Lab: BMR Calculator/ Lab 3 Part 1
This lab stood out because it made math, types, and formatting matter. I had to be precise about doubles vs. ints, casting, and order of operations so the numbers matched expectations across a range of inputs. I added clear prompts and validation to prevent nonsense values, then verified correctness with sample cases. The exercise reinforced how small mistakes (like integer division) can quietly break real formulas. It also pushed me to write neat, reusable functions and keep the output consistent and readable for users.
